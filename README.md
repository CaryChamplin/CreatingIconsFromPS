# Creating iOS and Mac OS icon assets from Adobe Photoshop

According to Apple's [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/) and [Mac OS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/), the following sets of icons are needed for products supporting the current and recent versions of iOS and Mac OS, respectively:

[Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (PS) can be used for creating the icon designs for both iOS and Mac OS. [PS scripts](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/scripting.html) permits the use of a single artboard on PS (or in this case, a single PNG file with a size of at least 1024x1024 pixels) to build the entire set of iPhone, iPad, Mac OS, and Apple Watch icons automagically.

**PS Scripts for Creating iOS and Mac OS App Icons**

PS supports use of external script files (e.g., JavaScript) that can be executed on a particular PS document from within PS or an image file. Here are the details:

- Since app icons are generated by PS from an external PNG image file, I have merged all the icons into one script.
- Scripts for PS can be written in various scripting languages, but this script is written in JavaScript.
- In my case with [PS](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), I placed the JavaScript file in the default script folder: '/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CC 2018/Presets/Scripts/'. Actually, any folder location will do. However, if the JavaScript file is placed in the default script folder, then PS includes it in the script list automagically. As shown below, the 'File' drop-down menu script selection in PS shows the icon export JavaScript file. The JavaScript file is short, simple, and easy to understand.

**Open Issue: Edge Artifact on Downsampling**

I am seeing an edge artifact (1 pixel wide along edges between high contrast objects) that could be associated with the downsampling option. Here is an example (76x76 pixels). What's interesting is I don't see this artifact with my Illustrator icon scripts. Just need to find a little time to resolve. It does imply that professional grade commercial apps should be tweaked at each resolution for optimal pixel-level design.
